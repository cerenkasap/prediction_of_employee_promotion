## Prediction of Employee Promotion - Binary Classification üèÜ: Project Overview

Applied **Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Bernoulli Naive Bayes**, and **KNeighborsClassifier** and optimized using **GridSearchCV** to find the best model.

### Code Used

Python version: *Python 3.7.11* 

### Resources Used

[Calculating the missing value ratio](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/04/beginners-guide-to-missing-value-ratio-and-its-implementation/)

## Data Collection

## Data Cleaning

## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Model Building


Data were split into **train (80%)** and **test (20%)** sets.

I used six models *(Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Bernoulli Bayes, and KNeighborsClassifier)* to predict the sentiment and evaluated them by using *Accuracy*.

## Model Performance Evalution
Logistic Regression model performed better than any other models in this project.

|Model                      |Test Accuracy Score|                      
| -------------             |:-----------------:|                       
|Decision Tree              |0.920834129240687 |
|Logistic Regression        |0.7677999936793536|
|Support Vector Classifier  |0.5890109471958787|
|Random Forest Classifier   |0.5638441049057488|
|Naive Bayes                |0.5997986184287554|
|K-Neighbots                |0.5013675213675214|
